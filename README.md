# Calculator App

### Just an ordinary calculator app.
 I made this project repository just try to learn about Provider State Management. I have to dive more deeper about Provider.

There are 2 kind of calculator in this Repository. For the first calculator i made with state management setState() on StatefulWidget. And i made another calculator with Provider State Management.

## Here are the link that lead to the code file:

### 1) [Calculator with state management setState](/lib/screens/main_screen.dart). The  logic and UI view are written in the same file

### 2) [Calculator with Provider state management](/lib/screens/calculator_with_controller.dart). I wrote the [controller](/lib/controller/calculator_controller.dart) and the [UI view](/lib/screens/calculator_with_controller.dart) in sparate files
